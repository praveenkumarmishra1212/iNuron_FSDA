
#1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
'''Ans-
    Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.'''
#2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?
'''Ans-
    The code in a function executes when the function is called'''
#3. What statement creates a function?
'''Ans-
    'def' statement'''
#4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
'''Ans-
    A function consists of the def statement and the code in its def clause.
A function call is what moves the program execution into the function, 
and the function call evaluates to the function's return value.'''
#5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
'''Ans-
    There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.
'''
#6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
'''Ans-
    When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten.'''
#7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?
'''Ans-
    A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, 
    a return value can be used as part of an expression.'''
#8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
'''Ans-
    return value is None.'''
def add(a,b):
    total= a+b
    #return total

output= add(2,3)
print(output)
None
#9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?
'''Ans-
    by A global statement '''
#10. What is the data type of None?
'''Ans-
    NoneType'''
#11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?
'''Ans-
    That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic. (This isn't a real Python module)'''
import areallyourpetsnamederic

#12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?
'''Ans-
    spam.bacon()'''
#13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?
'''Ans-
    Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause'''
#14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?
'''Ans-
    With Try clause we can prevent a code from crashing. With except clause we can execute a error causing code'''
