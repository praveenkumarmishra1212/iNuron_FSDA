#4. What are the values of the following expressions?
print((5 > 4) and (3 == 5))
print(not (5 > 4))
print((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
print(not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)))
print((True and True) and (True == False))

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans-
    less than ( < ), less than or equal to ( <= ), 
    greater than ( > ), greater than or equal to ( >= ),
    equal to ( == ), and not equal to ( != ).
    
'''6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Ans-
    The “=” is an assignment operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. 
    The '==' operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If so, it returns true. 
    Otherwise it returns false.
    Ex:'''
a= 5
b= 6
if a==b:
    print("a is equal to b")
else :
    print("a is not equal to b")
a is not equal to b
#7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')
else:
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')
    
    
ham
spam
spam
'''8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings!
if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans-'''
spam= input("enter the no ")
if spam=="1":
    print("Hello")
elif spam=="2":
    print("Howdi")
else :
    print("Greetings")
enter the no 54
Greetings
9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ans-
    Ctrl+C
    
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans-
    The main difference between both the statements is that when break keyword comes, 
    it terminates the execution of the current loop and passes the control over the next loop or main body, 
    whereas when continue keyword is encountered,
    it skips the current iteration and executes the very next iteration in the loop.
    
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans-
    There is no diffrence.
'''12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. 
Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans-'''

    print(i)
        
i= 1
while (i<=10):
    print(i)
